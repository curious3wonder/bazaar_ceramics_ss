## Conclusion
> Issues and Resolution/ Achievements 
* `Developer Tools` and `Inspect Element` were introduced to me at the last phase of this project. Using these could have improved the quality of CSS part with wiser choice of codes in clean manner(Especially for Responsive Design for User interface).
* Sadly, I got to know about `Git/GitHub` after graduating TAFE, which means, I didn't get any chance to experience the charm of Git/GitHub during the process of this projects. Tons of edits, saves and restores! Especially when my Windows laptop stopped working out of nowhere, sudden change of operating system to be Mac(My hubby's computer which became mine nowðŸ¤“) was a bit of challenge. Different tools and softwares were introduced just before the deadline. Now look back, I got to have a time to get used to the both big operating systems! But back then if I knew Git/GitHub, things could have gotten heaps easier. Well, I cannot wait to explore and to become a real beneficiary from using Git/GitHub for my next project!
* I learnt about using `server error_log file` and `echo check technique` for certain troubleshooting while developing diverse query performance. It is great how the Server error_log contains error messages for user-defined events/system events, which saved me a lot!
* `Terminal/command line system` is utilised to support with various database queries. This was too, interesting!
> Improvement Requirements
* Responsive design more to consider on UX/UI rather than just size-wise changes
* More to improve on appearance of web design details from the front-end view
